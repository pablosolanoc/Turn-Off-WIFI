# Turn-Off-WIFI
This python code turns off the Wi-Fi in a computer in the same network via sockets. 
It needs to be executed in the your computer and the one that you want to disconnect.

"server.py" needs to be executed in your computer (A).
"client.pyw" has to go in the computer you want to disconnect (B) from a local Wi-FI network.

Both have to run at the same time. It will keep on diconnecting until you stop "server.py" or "client.pyw"
is terminated from task manager.

"client.pyw" has extension .pyw so it doesn't show up in python IDLE or your prefered python executable application.

Use it well :)
